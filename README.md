my personal portfolio website

It's not a pure front-end / webapp project as the sketch file for designing is included. 
To initiate the project, you should first have npm (or cnpm for mainland China users) installed.
After cloning the repository to you computer, run the following command lines

$ cd PersonalPage
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
